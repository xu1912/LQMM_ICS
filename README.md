simulation.R
>Main simulation file taking generated simulate data as input and writing result analyzed by New_function to external files.

simulation_no_parallel.R
>Main simulation file but without parallele computing.

Comparison_functions.R
>Other functions we compared.

simulation_other_functions_no_parallel.R
